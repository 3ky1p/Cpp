Think of data structures as different kinds of storage boxes for your information.
A single variable is like one small box holding a single item. But what if you have a whole collection of things, like all your friend's names or your game scores? You need special containers designed for groups.
C++ gives you these ready-made "smart containers":
Vectors are like flexible lists that grow as you add items.
Maps are like dictionaries, connecting two pieces of information (like a word and its definition).
Sets are like bags that only keep unique items—no duplicates allowed.
Picking the right "storage box" makes your code neater and helps your program run faster and smoother. It's the first step to writing good code!
