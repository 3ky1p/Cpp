Preface ———— Algorithms
In C++, an "algorithm" is simply a step-by-step instruction set for solving a problem.
The best part is that C++ provides a huge collection of pre-built, efficient algorithms for common tasks like sorting, searching, and counting. Think of it as a toolbox of ready-made solutions.
Instead of writing complex code from scratch, you can often just pick the right algorithm for the job. This makes your programs shorter, faster, and more reliable.
Learning to use these built-in algorithms is a key step in becoming a proficient C++ programmer.
